## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What data types can object properties hold?
  Object properties can hold the following data types:
  Primitive data types: number, string, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol.
  Object data types: another object, arrays.
  Functions, any valid value.

- Describe the syntax (structure) of object-literals in JavaScript.
  In the beginning, declare an object like you would a variable: const keyword, identifier, and an equals sign.
  After the equals sign, add a curl bracket.
  After this, include name: value pairs, use a colon after the name instead of the equals sign.
  If there will be another key: value pair after the one you just declared, include a common after. Do not put a comma after the last key: value pair you declare inside of your object.
  Close off your object with a curly bracket and semi-colon.
  Ex.)

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: 'Malcolm',
  lastName: 'Abbott',
};
```
