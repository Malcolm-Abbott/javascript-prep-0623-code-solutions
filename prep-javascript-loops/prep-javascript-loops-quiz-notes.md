## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
  The purpose of condition in the for and while loops is to tell the for/while loop whether to execute a statement or not. So, if the conditions are met, execute the statement. If the conditions are not met, or once they are no longer met, do not execute the statement or stop executing the statement.

- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?
  The first expression (initialization) in a for loop is evaluated before the execution of the code block.
  It is only executed one time.

- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
  The second expression (condition) is evaluated before each loop iteration.
  This will be executed until the conditions are no longer met.

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
  The third expression in a for loop (final expression) is evaluated after the code block has been executed.
  This will happen every time the code block has been executed.

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?
  Generally the purpose of the final expression in a for loop is used to update or increment the counter variable.
  It can also subtract from the counter variable, and the like.
  This is important because it allows the loop to move on to the next element, like say for example, the next element
  in an array.

- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?
  The for in loops should be used on objects.
  For looping over other iterable data types (such as arrays), it's better to use the for loop.
